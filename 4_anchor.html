<h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p > Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ ⓘ GOO-ghəl) is an American 
    multinational corporation and technology company focusing on 
    online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing,
    computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics,
     and artificial intelligence (AI).[9] It has been referred to as "the 
     most powerful company in the world"[10] and is one of the world's most 
     valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and 
     technological advantages in the field of AI.[11][12][13] Google's parent company,
      Alphabet Inc., is one of the five Big Tech companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, 
      Meta, and Microsoft.</p>
<h3 id="History">HISTORY</h3><p > Google began in January 1996 as a research 
    project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at 
    Stanford University in California.[23][24][25] The project initially involved 
    an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who 
    wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before 
    Google was officially founded as a company;[26][27] Hassan went on to pursue a career 
    in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[28][29]</p>
<h3 id="Growth">GROWTH</h3><p>  In March 1999, the company moved its 
    offices to Palo Alto, California,[55] which is home to several prominent Silicon 
    Valley technology start-ups.[56] The next year, Google began selling advertisements 
    associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an 
    advertising-funded search engine.[57][25] To maintain an uncluttered page design, 
    advertisements were solely text-based.[58] In June 2000, it was announced that Google 
    would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular 
    websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[59][60]</p>
